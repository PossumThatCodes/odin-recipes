This project is a recipe site that I am building using the knowledge
I've learned from The Odin Project. I will be using HTML to build 
the foudations of the website.

During this project, I will be demonstrating the skills I've learned
so far in HTML. These include things such as making headers and
paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, adding images and links,
and handling multiple pages of a site
